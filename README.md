## File Structure

```

├── manifest.json      # Extension configuration

## How It Works

1. **Content Script**: Runs on YouTube pages and detects video elements
2. **Channel Detection**: Identifies the current video's channel URL
3. **URL Matching**: Compares channel URLs with your target list
4. **Skipping**: If matched, automatically skips to your specified time
5. **Settings**: Uses Chrome's storage API to save your preferences

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working?

1. **Check if Enabled**: Make sure the extension is enabled in the popup
2. **Verify Channel URLs**: Ensure the channel URLs are correctly added
3. **Check Console**: Open browser console (F12) to see debug messages
4. **Refresh Page**: Try refreshing the YouTube page
5. **Reinstall**: Remove and reload the extension

### Channel Not Detected?

1. **Wait for Page Load**: YouTube is a single-page app, wait a moment
2. **Check URL**: Make sure you're on a video page (`/watch`)
3. **Manual Check**: Look at the channel URL displayed in the popup
4. **Try Different Methods**: Use the "Add Current Channel" button

### Common Issues

- **Videos Don't Skip**: Check if the channel URL is in your target list
- **Wrong Skip Time**: Verify the duration setting in the popup
- **Extension Disappears**: Make sure you pinned it to the toolbar
